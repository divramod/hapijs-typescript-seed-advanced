# Description: node-hapi-typescript-seed

This is a simple hapijs (nodejs) starter template that should be used as an api.
It is inspired by [dwyl/hapi-typescript-example](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-typescript-example/tree/master/src).

env=testing db=testing port=8201 npm test # port change is needed to throw out all the loggings

# Run Production Server (default port 8100) with livereload on file change
port=8200 npm start # changes default port to 8200

# Typescript Lint
npm run tslint
```

# Testing

## TODO's
- [ ] is it possible/sensible to test an interface?


## Links
Uses the (chai-assert testing library)[http://chaijs.com/api/assert/].

## Route Testing
Is inspired by the method https://github.com/hapijs/discuss/issues/214 describes.

## Database/Repository Testing
When you start ```npm test``` with the environment variable ```db=testing``` the test server will create a mongodb with location testingdb.

# Documentation
The Documentation is Running on port 8100 by default settings.
Go to http://localhost:8100/documentation to see the documentation generated by [swagger](http://swagger.io/).

# How To's

## Merging latest upstream changes

1. `npm run merge.preview` - This will fetch `upstream` and show you how the merge would look
2. `npm run merge` - This will actually do the merge
3. Handle any conflicts to get latest upstream into your application.
4. Continue building your app.

You can read more about [syncing a fork here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).

If you have any suggestions to this workflow, please post [here](https://github.com/divramod/hapi-seed-advanced/issues).

## How to use in your project
There are at least two ways to integrate the api in your project. As a submodule to an existing project or as standalone project.

### Add as a submodule to an existing project
1. create a repository for your api-server (for example server-api)
2. add that repository as a submodule to your project
```
cd YOUR_PROJECT
git submodule add https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_NAME/server-api.git
```
3. download the hapi-seed-advanced zip (do not clone it)
4. extract the zip-content into your submodule (server-api)
5. add upstream
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/divramod/hapi-seed-advanced.git
```
6. install dependencies
```
npm install
typings install
```

### Create as standalone project
1. create a repository for your api-server
2. download the hapi-seed-advanced zip (do not clone it)
3. extract the zip-content into your submodule (server-api)
4. add upstream
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/divramod/hapi-seed-advanced.git
```
